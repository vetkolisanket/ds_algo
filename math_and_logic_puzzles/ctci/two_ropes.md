You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes? Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope length-w ise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

From start to end, our approach is as follows:
1. Lightrope1atbothendsandrope2atoneend.
2. When the two flames on Rope 1 meet. 30 minutes will have passed. Rope 2 has 30 minutes left of burn- time.
3. At that point, light Rope 2 at the other end.
4. In exactly fifteen minutes, Rope 2 will be completely burnt.
