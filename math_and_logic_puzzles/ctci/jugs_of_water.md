Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Soln: 
1. Fill the 5 quarts jugg. 
2. Fill the 3 quarts jugg with the 5 quarts jugg. 
3. You'll have 2 quarts remaining in the 5 quarts jugg. 
4. Empty the 3 quarts jugg. 
5. Fill the remaining 2 quarts from the 5 quarts jugg into the 3 quarts jugg. 
6. So 1 quarts vol is still left to be filled in the 3 quarts jugg. 
7. Fill the 5 quarts jugg. 
8. Fill the remaining 1 quart of the 3 quart jugg using 5 quart jugg. 
9. The remaining water in 5 quart jugg is 4 quarts
