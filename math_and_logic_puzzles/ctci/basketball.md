Basketball: You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

SOLUTION
To solve this problem, we can apply straightforward probability laws by comparing the probabilities of winning each game.
Probability of winning Game 1:
The probability of winning Game 1 is p, by definition.


Probability of winning Game 2:
Let 5 (k) n) be the probability of making exactly k shots out of n.The probability of winning Game 2 is the probability of making exactly two shots out of three OR making all three shots. In other words:
P(winning) = s(2)3) + 5(3)3)
The probability of making all three shots is: s(3)3) = p3
The probability of making exactly two shots is:
P(making 1 and 2) and missing 3)
+ P(making 1 and 3) and missing 2) + P(missing 1) and making 2 and 3)
p * p * (1 - p) + P * (1 - p) * p + (1 - p) * p * P 3 (1 _ p) p'
Adding these together, we get:
p3+ 3 (1 _ p) p2 p3 + 3p2 _ 3p3 3p2 _ 2p3
Which game should you play?
You should play Game 1 if P(Game 1)
p > 3p2 _ 2p3.
1 > 3p - 2p2
2p2 - 3p + 1 > 0
(2p - l)(p - 1) > 0
> P(Game 2):
Both terms must be positive, or both must be negative. But we know p < 1, so p - 1 < a.This means both terms must be negative.
2p - 1 < 0 2p < 1 P<.5
So,weshouldplayGame1ifa<p < â€¢5andGame2if.5 <P <1.
IfP =a,a.5,or1,thenP(Game 1) =P(Game 2),so it doesn't matter which game we play.
